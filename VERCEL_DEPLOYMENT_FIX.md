## Deployment Steps:

git push
```

### 2. Vercel Configuration
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings > General
4. Set Build Command: `npm run build`
5. Set Output Directory: `build`
6. Set Install Command: `npm install`

### 3. Environment Variables (if needed)
Add any required environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
- NODE_ENV=production

### 4. Redeploy
- Trigger a new deployment from Vercel dashboard
- Or push new changes to trigger auto-deployment

## Testing:
1. Visit your Vercel URL
2. Navigate to `/admin`
3. Login with credentials:
   - Username: `lacoiffure`
   - Password: `Lacoiffure@2020`
4. Test all admin panel functionality

## Common Issues & Solutions:

### Issue: 404 on admin routes
**Solution**: The vercel.json and _redirects files should fix this

### Issue: Admin panel loads but data doesn't work
**Solution**: Check browser console for localStorage errors, may need to add error handling

### Issue: Build fails
**Solution**: Check that all dependencies are in package.json and run `npm install` locally first

### Issue: Admin login doesn't work
**Solution**: Check if localStorage is available in production, may need to add error handling

## Additional Recommendations:

1. **Add Error Boundaries**: Wrap admin components in error boundaries
2. **Add Loading States**: Better loading indicators for production
3. **Add Error Handling**: Handle localStorage errors gracefully
4. **Add Logging**: Console logs for debugging production issues
5. **Test Locally**: Run `npm run build && npm run serve` to test production build locally

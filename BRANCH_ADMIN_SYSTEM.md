# Branch-Based Admin System

## Overview
The La Coiffure Salon admin panel now supports branch-based access control, allowing different administrators to manage specific branches or all branches based on their assigned permissions.

## Features

### üè¢ Branch Management
- **Powai Branch**: Located at Galleria Mall, Powai

## Technical Implementation

### Branch Context

} = useBranch();
```

### API Integration
```javascript

const appointments = await appointmentsAPI.getAll(currentBranch);

// Load analytics for specific branch
const stats = await analyticsAPI.getDashboardStats(currentBranch);
```

const branches = [
  {
    id: 'powai',
    name: 'Powai Branch',
    location: 'Powai (Galleria)',
    whatsapp: '+917400068615',
    // ... other properties
  },
  {
    id: 'thane', 
    name: 'Thane Branch',

## API Endpoints

### Branch-Filtered Endpoints
- `GET /api/appointments?branch={branchId}`
- `GET /api/analytics/dashboard?branch={branchId}`
- `POST /api/whatsapp/test` (with branch parameter)

### Branch Management
- `GET /api/branches` - List all branches

This system ensures that each branch operates independently while maintaining centralized management capabilities for super admins.
